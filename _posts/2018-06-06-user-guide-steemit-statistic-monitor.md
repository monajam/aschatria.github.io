One of the best way to preview what is going on with your Steemit account is a use of a few interesting pages. 


[SteemD](https://steemd.com/)
SteemD is a simple website where you can find all the general things about your account and these information are almost instantly refreshed. 


To see your information go to this link:
https://steemd.com/@username


[SteemWorld](https://steemworld.org/)
This is yet another website where you can see things related to your account with the beautiful statistic and desktop notifications. IN case you keep a browser tab open on that page it will send you notifications every time something happens to your account.
