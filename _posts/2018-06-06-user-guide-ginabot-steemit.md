To use GinaBot ( Discord notification bot for Steemit users) ,you have to be a member of the Steemit with approved account and you have to signup in Discord chat application.


[GinaBOT](https://steemit.com/@ginabot) runs from this [server](https://discord.gg/UeuV5Rb).
When there go to **register** channel and type this:


```
..reg username
```


After that command the bot will guide you what to do. 
You will also need to send Ginabot 0.001 sbd and in case you don't have it you can always contact some other Steemian, or in the best case contact me with teh details and I will help you.
